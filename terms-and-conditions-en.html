                <h2><strong>User Representations</strong></h2>

                4.1 In the case of Thai national users, users represent that they are legally competent or have obtained legal consent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Service and/or to enter into any contracts related to the use of the Service.<br><br>

                In the case of Foreign users, users represent that they are competent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Service and/or to enter into any contracts related to the use of the Service, in accordance with the laws of their own country.<br><br>

                Users understand that they are responsible for any financial or other consequences that arise or may arise from the use of the Service by users or by allowing third parties to use the user's registration information, password, or any other information.<br><br>

                4.2 Users represent that they will not use the Service for financial transactions with unlawful purposes, whether gambling, prostitution, money laundering, or using the Account for profit as a payment collection agent, or for conducting business in various forms, including actions that violate public order and morality, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, or any other illegal actions. Users will not damage the application or networks connected to the application, or interfere with the use of the application by any other person, or attempt to access the application or networks connected to the application without authorization by means of hacking, stealing, copying, or destroying databases, password mining, or any other method. Therefore, if any damage occurs to the Company, or the Company is held liable for any reason due to users conducting financial transactions through the Company's Service for the above purposes, or due to users taking any action related to the above application, the Company has the right to immediately suspend or terminate the Service, and users must compensate the Company for all damages. The Company shall have no involvement or responsibility for any damages that may occur.<br><br>

                4.3 Users represent that the information provided to the Company under Section 2.1 of these Terms and Conditions of Service, and any other information submitted to the Company, is accurate in all respects. If the Company discovers that users have forged documents and/or impersonated any person, whether or not that person consented to the registration for this Service, the Company reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate the Service, and users must compensate the Company for all damages, regardless of whether users had fraudulent intent.<br><br>

                4.4 Users represent that at the time users verify their identity through the Biometric Face Recognition verification process according to the Company's identification and verification procedures, users have performed such verification themselves, not by a twin or any other person who resembles the user.<br><br>

                Users represent that any transaction made with the user's Account through the Biometric Face Recognition verification process is an action performed by users themselves, and such transactions are complete and accurate. If any damage occurs from such transactions, users acknowledge that the Company shall not be responsible for any damages whatsoever.<br><br>

                4.5 For the purpose of identity verification, users represent that the national identification card used for identity verification according to the Company's identification and verification procedures is the user's national identification card containing accurate, true, and current personal information of the user. The photograph on such card represents the current appearance of the user, and is not different due to cosmetic surgery or any other action that has changed the user's appearance, and can truly identify the user's identity and characteristics at the time users perform identity verification according to the procedures specified by the Company.<br><br>

                If the user's appearance has changed due to the above actions, resulting in the identity verification system being unable to verify that it is the same person, users agree and acknowledge that the Company has the right to refuse to activate the Service or suspend the user's Service, and users agree not to raise such cause as a claim or take any other action against the Company.<br><br>

                4.6 Users represent that they agree to be bound, comply with, and cooperate, including agreeing to prepare information and/or submit evidence or any documents that the Company may request to be submitted for the purpose of considering activation of the Service, providing the Service, conducting any transactions, or complying with the regulations and announcements of the Bank of Thailand, the Anti-Money Laundering Office, or the provisions of any laws related to the implementation of these Terms and Conditions of Service, both currently existing and/or that may exist in the future, strictly.<br><br>

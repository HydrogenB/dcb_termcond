The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse to provide this service if the Service User's telecommunications service registration is found to be non-compliant with the criteria prescribed by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission ("NBTC"), or for any other legal reasons, without any obligation to inform the Service User of the reasons for such refusal.<br><br>

                4. The Service Provider reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of this service without prior notice to the Service User.<br><br>
